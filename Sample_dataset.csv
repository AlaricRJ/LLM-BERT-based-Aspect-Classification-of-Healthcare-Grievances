"I have come to Batra hospital 2nd time, first visit was horrible when I brought my mother here in an emergency and I met Dr Arora who was supposed to be a senior doctor. His attitude towards us was as if he's some kind of king and we're savages.
 
 He was unwilling to talk and when I asked whats his plan of action he asked us to leave! Today I've come to Neuro specialist Dr choudhary who's supposed to start seeing patients from 11am and I'm sitting here with my sick mother and at 1pm the doctor has still not showed up, yet.
 
 Receptionist doesn't know his whereabouts, it's worse than AIIMS or any other govt hospital. I urge that doctors are to be brought under service sector and to be strictly observed so that they adhere to time line, meanwhile I advice nobody to visit Batra Hospital",Complaint,Complaint,,Complaint,,,Complaint,,Complaint,

Sevenhills is big in a criminal manner. Its a very irreaponsible hospital with assistant doctors handling most.

"Worst. You will waste your money. They are only here to mint money. There are huge price difference if you get chemo from Shalimar bagh it will cost only 21k but here they charge more than 28k and they do not ahve ambulance or emergency care service for any query they will send you to go Max Saket. The management, nurses are alwys talking then actually working. Do not go there as a small unit they only think about profit to survive. Doctor Jhulka is good but most of the time he own't even remember you name forget about case, nurses are always hurry to go home early. On duty doctor won't even take your call",Complaint,Complaint,,,,,Complaint,,,Complaint
Nurses and support staff are just clueless and many times missed on prescribed medicine which is to be given to patients who are admitted.

"I have been to Batra hospital once with my friend when she has severe stomach pain. At the afternoon time there was no nearby clinic open, so we rushed towards Batra Hospital.
 
 After filling some details they examined the patient on time and immediately written some test and put glucose to her. Without telling exact reason for the pain, they first pressurize to perform the written tests that cost around Rs. 1000.
 
 After the test they have given injection and disclosed that the pain may be cause of food poison. So, after charging more than 2000 bucks the problem found is food poison. My friend got immediate relief and that would add a plus to this hospital. But, creating unnecessary hush and making a big scene while charging high is seriously not justified. They should need to take care of their both in term of relief and money.",Mixed,,,,,,Complaint,,,Complaint
